# Builder Gel vs Poly Gel: Key Differences, Pros and Cons

Builder gel nails and poly gel both cure under LED/UV, but they handle differently. I reach for each based on control, speed, and client nail type. Here’s the breakdown I give clients and junior techs.

## What You’ll Learn
- Texture and work-time differences between builder gel and poly gel
- How removal and maintenance compare
- Which system suits beginners, slow workers, or shaky hands
- Product suggestions for each category

## Side-by-Side
| Factor | Builder Gel | Poly Gel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consistency | Self-leveling, medium-viscosity | Thick, putty-like; needs slip solution |
| Work Time | Shorter—move efficiently before self-leveling sets | Unlimited until cured; great for slower shaping |
| Curing | LED/UV 60–120s | LED/UV 60–120s |
| Filing | Less filing if apex is built cleanly | Often more filing to perfect shape |
| Removal | File thin + soak (if soak-off) | File thin + soak; some require more filing |
| Best For | Structured overlays, short-medium extensions | Custom shaping, dual forms, minimizing self-leveling drift |

## When I Choose Builder Gel
- I need a smooth overlay on weak nails with minimal filing.
- I want faster appointments; self-leveling saves time once you master control.
- Client prefers lighter feel and easy soak-off maintenance.

## When I Choose Poly Gel
- A client or student wants more working time to perfect shape.
- I’m building on dual forms or want less self-leveling movement.
- The client is hard on their hands and needs a slightly firmer feel.

(Use your preferred poly gel; keep slip solution minimal to avoid bubbles.)

## Removal and Maintenance
Both systems benefit from filing to a thin layer before soaking. Poly gel can take a few extra minutes to file down because of its density. For either system, I infill two to three times if the base is intact; otherwise remove fully.

## Common Issues and Fixes
- **Builder gel flooding:** use less product, angle the finger down, flash cure sooner.
- **Poly gel bubbles:** too much slip solution; float, don’t scrub.
- **Under-curing:** confirm lamp output and give 90–120s for dense thumbs.
- **Cracking:** missing apex or nails too long for the product’s flexibility.

## Key Mistakes to Avoid
- Flooding slip solution into poly gel; it creates bubbles and weak spots.
- Letting builder gel self-level too long; work efficiently before it drifts.
- Using thin apex on long lengths; both systems need a stress point.
- Under-curing dense thumbs; give 90–120s in a 48W+ lamp.
- Expecting soak-off without filing thin first; both need bulk removal before acetone.

## FAQs

**Is poly gel stronger than builder gel?**
It’s often a bit firmer than soak-off builder gels, but strength depends on thickness and apex. Semi-hard builder gels like Kokoist feel comparable.

**Which is easier for beginners?**
Poly gel’s longer work time helps slow workers. Builder gel is easier once you learn to float the bead without overworking.

**Do both soak off?**
Most builder gels and many poly gels are soak-off when thinned properly. Hard formulas need full file-off.

**Which feels lighter?**
Builder gel/BIAB overlays feel lighter. Poly gel can feel denser if applied thick.

## Final Expert Advice (Sara Kim)
Choose builder gel for speed and a sleek overlay; choose poly gel when you need unlimited work time or dual forms. Either way, keep product off skin, build a proper apex, and commit to full cures—those habits matter more than the label on the jar.
