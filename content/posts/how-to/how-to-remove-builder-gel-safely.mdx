Removing builder gel incorrectly is one of the fastest ways to damage your natural nails. In my years of doing nails, I've seen too many people peel off their gel (ouch!) or file too aggressively. Here's how to do it right.

## Choose Your Method

There are two main ways to remove builder gel:

1. **Soak-off method** - Best for soft, soak-off formulas
2. **E-file method** - Best for hard gel or when you want to keep some structure

## Method 1: Soak-Off Removal

### What You'll Need:
- 100% pure acetone
- Cotton balls or pads
- Aluminum foil
- Nail file (180 grit)
- Cuticle oil
- Nail buffer

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: File the Top Layer**
Gently file the shiny top coat to break the seal. This allows acetone to penetrate. Don't file into the builder gel itself—just the top layer.

**Step 2: Prepare Your Wraps**
Soak cotton pads in acetone and place them on each nail.

**Step 3: Wrap in Foil**
Wrap each finger tightly in aluminum foil. The tighter the wrap, the faster the process.

**Step 4: Wait 15-20 Minutes**
Be patient! Don't unwrap early. The gel needs time to break down.

**Step 5: Check Progress**
Unwrap one nail to check. The gel should be lifting or crumbly. If not, rewrap for another 5-10 minutes.

**Step 6: Gently Remove**
Use a cuticle pusher to gently scrape off the softened gel. Never force it—if it's not coming off easily, soak longer.

**Step 7: Nourish Your Nails**
Wash hands, apply cuticle oil generously, and give your nails a break if needed.

## Method 2: E-File Removal

This method is faster but requires more skill. If you're new to e-files, practice on tips first.

### Tips for Safe E-Filing:
- Use a medium grit barrel bit
- Keep the file moving—never stay in one spot
- Stop when you see your natural nail
- Leave a thin layer if doing a fill

## After Removal Care

Your nails may feel weak after removal. Help them recover:

- Apply cuticle oil daily
- Use a nail strengthener if desired
- Avoid harsh chemicals for a few days
- Consider a "naked nail" break before reapplying

## When to Seek Professional Help

If you're unsure about removal, visit a nail tech. It's worth the cost to protect your natural nails from damage.
