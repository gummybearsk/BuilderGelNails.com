This is exactly how I apply builder gel nails and BIAB on real clients: meticulous prep, a controlled slip layer, a balanced apex, and cures that prevent lifting or heat spikes. Follow these steps and you’ll get a three-week wear without wrecking the nail plate.

## What You’ll Learn
- The prep sequence that prevents lifting and sidewall pockets
- How to place a slip layer and bead for a clean apex
- Cure times I use for Beetles, Modelones, Kokoist, and BIAB
- Tips to avoid flooding, bubbles, and heat spikes
- When to flash cure vs. full cure and how to finish safely

## Prep for Long Wear
- Sanitize and dehydrate every nail; oils are enemy number one.
- Push back cuticles thoroughly; invisible cuticle causes lifting.
- Lightly etch with a 180-grit buffer; remove all dust with alcohol.
- Apply primer for oily nails or habitual lifters.

## Base Coat and Slip Layer
A true base coat anchors adhesion; a slip layer guides the bead.

1. Apply a thin base coat; cap the free edge. Cure 30–60s.
2. Apply a super-thin slip layer of builder gel—keep off skin.

**My lamp notes:** Beetles and Modelones behave best with a 60–120s LED cure. Kokoist often fully sets in 20–30s under 48W, but I still give 60s for thicker overlays.

## Building the Apex (Structure)
The apex reinforces the stress point. If it’s missing, you’ll see cracks or breaks.

1. Pick up a bead, place mid-nail, glide toward the cuticle leaving a hairline gap.
2. Tilt the finger to let the gel self-level; chase any flooding with a clean brush.
3. Flash cure 10–20s per nail to freeze the shape.

## Full Cure, Wipe, and Refine
- Full cure 60–120s based on brand and lamp strength.
- Wipe inhibition layer if your top coat requires it.
- File with a 180-grit to refine sidewalls and apex; use light pressure to avoid heat.

Seal with a no-wipe top coat; cap edges and cure to spec. A rubbery feel means under-cure—add 30–60s.

## Product Examples and Why I Use Them

- Beetles: forgiving self-level, but extend cure to 120s to clear tackiness.
- Modelones: non-lifting formula; good for oily nails with proper prep.
- Gelish Structure: stiff brush control; excellent for crisp apex on short nails.
- Kokoist: semi-hard feel; ideal when clients need extra strength in a thin overlay.

## Troubleshooting From the Salon Chair
- **Flooding cuticles:** use less product, angle the finger down, and flash cure sooner.
- **Bubbles:** overworking the bead introduces air—float, don’t scrub. Warm thick gel slightly for smoother flow.
- **Heat spikes:** apply thinner layers, flash cure first, and switch to low-heat mode if available.
- **Lifting:** check for cuticle debris, switch to a dehydrator + primer combo, and ensure full cures.

## Quick Infills (2–3 Week Maintenance)
1. File down bulk; leave a thin base layer intact.
2. Re-prep the regrowth area; avoid touching old product with primer.
3. Rebuild apex only where needed; don’t keep adding thickness to the tip.
4. Seal and cure as usual.

## Key Mistakes to Avoid
- Flooding the cuticle or sidewalls; always leave a hairline gap.
- Relying on one 30–45s cure; give 60–120s, especially on thumbs.
- Building the apex too far forward; center it just behind the free edge.
- Over-filing the surface after cure; it thins strength and invites cracks.
- Skipping primer on oily nails; use it when lifting is a pattern.

## FAQs

**Do I need a base coat under BIAB?**
I still do. Some BIAB systems allow base-free, but base adds insurance against lifting, especially on oily nails.

**Why is my builder gel still sticky after curing?**
That’s the inhibition layer. Either top coat directly or wipe with alcohol. If it’s mushy, add cure time or check your lamp output.

**How thick should the apex be?**
Slightly thicker than the sidewalls—enough to resist bending but not bulky. On short nails, the apex is subtle but still present.

**Can I extend with forms?**
Yes. Apply base, slip layer, build structure over forms, flash cure, then fully cure and refine. Keep extensions short for beginners.

**Is HEMA-free necessary?**
If a client has sensitivity, yes—try Au Lait BIAB. Otherwise, the key is keeping product off skin and fully curing.

## Final Expert Advice (Sara Kim)
Respect prep, master the slip layer, and flash cure to keep shape. Builder gel rewards patience: thin base, controlled bead, and full cures. When in doubt, use less product, add an extra 30s under a strong lamp, and never chase speed over safety. That’s how you get builder gel nails that survive daily life without lifting.
