# Why Builder Gel or BIAB Cracks and How to Stop It (Step-by-Step Troubleshooting)

If builder gel nails or BIAB are cracking, the apex, length, or cure is off. I see this most on long, flat nails and rushed thumb cures. Use this checklist to stop cracks before they start.

## What You’ll Learn
- Structural mistakes that create stress cracks
- How to size length to the client’s lifestyle
- Cure-time adjustments that strengthen semi-hard and soak-off gels
- Quick fixes you can apply at the next appointment

## Structural Mistakes
- **Missing apex:** flat nails flex and crack at the stress point. Build the apex just behind the free edge.
- **Too long for the product:** soak-off builders flex more; keep lengths short-medium unless you switch to a semi-hard formula.
- **Thin sidewalls:** over-filing thins support; keep even thickness along the edges.

## Build Strength the Right Way

1. Apply a thin slip layer for control.
2. Place a bead and float it to create a visible apex.
3. Flash cure 10–20s, then full cure 60–120s.

## Length and Product Choice
- Short to medium overlays: Beetles or Modelones with a modest apex.
- Medium with more strength: Kokoist semi-hard builder gives extra rigidity in thin layers.
- Long extensions: consider acrylic or a thicker semi-hard gel; BIAB overlays alone may flex too much.

## Cure Time Matters
Dense thumbs and thicker overlays may need 90–120s even with strong lamps. If the free edge looks dull or scratches easily, add 30–60s. Rotate thumbs toward the lamp for full exposure.

## Quick Repair Playbook
- File away the crack gently; thin the area without touching the natural nail.
- Rebuild apex locally with a small bead; flash cure, then full cure.
- If cracks are widespread, remove to a thin layer and start fresh with shorter length.

## Key Mistakes to Avoid
- Extending soak-off builder gels too long; keep lengths realistic for their flex.
- Flattening the apex during filing; it removes the stress point.
- Using one short cure on dense thumbs; add 30–60s and rotate the thumb.
- Building too thin at sidewalls; they need even support.
- Reusing cracked product; always remove and rebuild cleanly.

## FAQs

**Why do cracks start at the free edge?**
Usually missing apex or nails extended beyond what a flexible builder can support.

**Do I need a harder gel?**
If you want longer lengths, yes—use a semi-hard builder like Kokoist or consider acrylic for maximum rigidity.

**Can top coat prevent cracks?**
No. Structure and cure prevent cracks; top coat only seals.

**Does over-filing cause cracks?**
Yes. Over-filing sidewalls or thinning the apex removes strength and invites breaks.

## Final Expert Advice (Sara Kim)
Match length to product strength, build a real apex, and cure with intention. When cracks appear, shorten, rebuild, and switch to a firmer gel if needed. Builder gel nails stay intact when you pair proper structure with full cures and realistic lengths.
