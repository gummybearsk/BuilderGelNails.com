# Why Builder Gel or BIAB Is Sticky or Lifts (and How to Fix It)

Sticky after curing can be normal; lifting is almost always a prep or curing issue. Here’s how I diagnose builder gel nails and BIAB when clients return with tacky layers or sidewall pop-offs.

## What You’ll Learn
- The difference between a normal inhibition layer and true under-curing
- Prep mistakes that cause lifting within days
- How lamp strength, cure times, and product thickness affect stickiness
- My checklist to fix lifting before the next set

## Sticky After Curing: Normal vs. Problem
- **Normal:** inhibition layer feels tacky but firm underneath. Wipe or top coat and it’s gone.
- **Problem:** product feels rubbery or dents easily—likely under-cured. Solutions: extend cure to 90–120s, check lamp output, and apply thinner layers.

## Lifting Causes I See Most
1. Incomplete prep—cuticle left on the plate.
2. Product touching skin—creates a peel point.
3. Under-curing—weak lamp, thick layers, or rushed thumbs.
4. Skipped base coat—relying on builder gel alone on oily nails.
5. Over-filing the surface after cure—thins the bond.

## Fixes That Work
- **Upgrade prep:** meticulous cuticle removal and a dehydrator + primer for lifters.
- **Control placement:** keep a hairline gap at the cuticle; use a stiffer brush (BIAB) if flooding is common.
- **Cure to spec:** 60–120s under a 48W LED; 120s for Beetles/Modelones if sticky persists.
- **Flash cure thumbs separately:** they sit sideways and often under-cure.
- **Thin, even layers:** especially near sidewalls and cuticle—bulk belongs at the apex.

## When to File Off and Reapply
If lifting reaches the base or multiple nails pop, file down to a thin layer, redo prep, and rebuild. Small sidewall lifts can be carefully rebased, but only if the foundation is solid and there’s no moisture intrusion.

## Key Mistakes to Avoid
- Applying thick near the cuticle; leave a gap and keep that area thin.
- Using old lamps or short cures; most formulas need 60–120s under 48W+.
- Skipping primer on oily nails; it’s essential for habitual lifters.
- Wiping inhibition with acetone; use alcohol to avoid dulling the surface.
- Reusing files across clients; cross-contamination can mimic lifting issues.

## FAQs

**Is the inhibition layer bad for nails?**
No—it’s part of the curing process. Seal it with top coat or cleanse before filing.

**Why do only my thumbs lift?**
Thumbs sit sideways and often miss direct lamp exposure. Cure thumbs separately for 90–120s.

**Can I skip primer?**
I only skip it on dry, non-lifting clients. For oily nails, primer drastically improves adhesion.

**Does HEMA-free cure differently?**
Cure times are similar, but HEMA-free BIAB still needs thin, even layers and full exposure.

## Final Expert Advice (Sara Kim)
Treat stickiness as normal unless the product feels rubbery. For lifting, assume prep or curing until proven otherwise: clean the nail plate perfectly, keep gel off skin, and give every nail a full-strength cure. Builder gel nails stay on when you respect those fundamentals.
