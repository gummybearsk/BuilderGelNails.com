# Builder Gel Lifting: Causes and Fixes

Lifting is the #1 frustration I hear about from both beginners and experienced nail enthusiasts. When your beautiful manicure starts peeling at the edges after just a few days, it's incredibly frustrating. Let's fix that.

## Why Does Builder Gel Lift?

In my experience, lifting almost always comes down to one of these issues:

1. **Inadequate nail prep** (most common)
2. **Product touching the skin**
3. **Oil or moisture on the nail plate**
4. **Incompatible products**
5. **Under-curing**

Let's go through each one.

## Cause #1: Inadequate Nail Prep

This is responsible for about 70% of lifting issues.

### Signs It's Your Prep:
- Lifting starts at the cuticle area
- Happens with different products
- Lifting appears within 1-3 days

### The Fix:
1. **Push cuticles properly** - Use a quality cuticle pusher and remove ALL dead skin from the nail plate
2. **Remove the shine** - Lightly buff the entire nail surface with a 180-grit file
3. **Clean thoroughly** - Use a dehydrator, let it air dry completely
4. **Apply primer** - Use a primer appropriate for your gel system

## Cause #2: Product Touching Skin

Even a microscopic amount of gel on your skin or cuticle will lift.

### Signs It's Product Placement:
- Lifting only at cuticle or sidewalls
- You can see a tiny gap where lifting started

### The Fix:
- Leave a 1mm gap around all edges
- Use a thin brush for precise application
- Clean up any floods BEFORE curing
- Cap the free edge to seal the product

## Cause #3: Oil or Moisture

Nail plates absorb oils and water, which prevents proper adhesion.

### Signs It's Oil/Moisture:
- Lifting is random across the nail
- Worse after showering or applying lotions

### The Fix:
- Don't apply hand cream before doing nails
- Use a quality dehydrator
- Apply nails when hands are completely dry
- Consider using a nail prep solution

## Cause #4: Incompatible Products

Not all gels work well together.

### Signs It's Compatibility:
- Lifting started when you changed products
- Works fine with the original brand

### The Fix:
- Stick to one brand system when possible
- If mixing brands, do adhesion tests first
- Use a universal bonding base if needed

## Cause #5: Under-Curing

Gel that isn't fully cured won't bond properly.

### Signs It's Curing:
- Gel feels soft or tacky even after curing
- Lifting happens throughout the nail, not just edges

### The Fix:
- Check your lamp wattage (48W minimum recommended)
- Don't apply gel too thick (thick layers don't cure properly)
- Cure for the full recommended time
- Replace lamp bulbs every 6-12 months

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

Before your next application, verify:

- [ ] Cuticles pushed back and cleaned
- [ ] Nail plate buffed (not shiny)
- [ ] Dehydrator applied and dried
- [ ] Primer applied (if using)
- [ ] 1mm gap at cuticle and sidewalls
- [ ] Free edge capped
- [ ] Each layer cured completely
- [ ] Lamp is working properly

## When Lifting Still Happens

Some people are just prone to lifting due to:
- Oily nail beds
- Nail medications
- Hormonal changes
- Certain health conditions

If you've tried everything, consider:
- Trying a different gel formula
- Using an extra bonding layer
- Accepting shorter wear time (7-10 days vs 3 weeks)
