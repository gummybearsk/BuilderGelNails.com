If you're new to builder gel, welcome! In my experience, builder gel is the most beginner-friendly way to achieve strong, beautiful, salon-quality nails at home. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

## What is Builder Gel?

Builder gel is a thick, self-leveling gel that can be used to:
- Strengthen natural nails
- Add length with tips or forms
- Create a protective overlay
- Fix broken or damaged nails

Unlike traditional gel polish, builder gel has more structure and can support extensions.

## What You'll Need

Before your first application, gather these essentials:

1. **Builder gel** - Start with a self-leveling formula
2. **UV/LED lamp** - 48W recommended for even curing
3. **Nail prep products** - Dehydrator and primer
4. **Nail file and buffer** - 180 grit for shaping, 240 for smoothing
5. **Cuticle pusher** - Metal or wooden
6. **Lint-free wipes** - For cleaning
7. **Isopropyl alcohol** - 70% or higher

## Step-by-Step Application

### Step 1: Nail Preparation

Proper prep is 80% of a good manicure. Here's what I do:

1. Push back cuticles gently
2. Remove any dead skin from the nail plate
3. Lightly buff the nail surface (don't go crazy)
4. Clean with alcohol and lint-free wipe
5. Apply dehydrator, let air dry
6. Apply primer to the free edge only

### Step 2: Base Coat (Optional)

Some builder gels are designed to be used directly on the nail, while others work better with a base coat. Check your product's instructions.

### Step 3: Builder Gel Application

1. Apply a thin first layer, capping the free edge
2. Cure for 30-60 seconds
3. Apply your structural layer (this is where you build the apex)
4. Let the gel self-level for 10-15 seconds
5. Cure for full recommended time (usually 60 seconds)

### Step 4: Shaping and Finishing

1. File to your desired shape
2. Buff smooth
3. Apply top coat if desired
4. Cure final layer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Touching the cuticle area** - Keep a tiny gap to prevent lifting
- **Applying too thick** - Build in layers, not one thick coat
- **Skipping prep** - This is the #1 cause of lifting
- **Under-curing** - Make sure your lamp is strong enough

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, try:
- Creating an apex for extra strength
- Adding tips for length
- Learning fill-in techniques
