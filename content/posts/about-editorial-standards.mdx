# About Us & Editorial Standards

I’m Sara Kim, a licensed nail technician with 8+ years behind the table specializing in builder gel nails, BIAB, and structured manicures. Every guide on this site reflects real techniques I use on clients—no generic AI filler, no untested claims.

## Who I Am
- Licensed nail tech with eight years in salon and studio environments
- Specialize in builder gels (pot and bottle), BIAB, and soft-gel overlays
- Safety-first approach: clean prep, proper cures, and gentle removal

## How I Test Products
- I apply each builder gel or BIAB on real clients and practice tips before recommending.
- I record viscosity, self-level speed, brush stiffness, and cure times under a 48W LED.
- I note reactions on sensitive clients and prefer HEMA-free options when needed.
- I compare wear after 2–3 weeks, watching for lifting, cracking, or discoloration.

## Editorial Principles
- **Accuracy over hype:** If a formula needs 120s to cure cleanly, we say it.
- **Safety first:** We emphasize prep, skin avoidance, and proper removal to protect nail health.
- **No pay-to-play:** Brands do not buy placement. We cover only products we’d use on clients.
- **Regular updates:** Cure times, formulas, and best practices change—we update articles as we learn.

## Affiliate Disclosure
Some links are affiliate links. When you buy through them, we may earn a commission. This never changes our verdicts; it simply keeps the site running. We recommend products only after hands-on use and ingredient review.

## How We Handle Content
- Every article is written in my voice and checked for technique accuracy.
- Internal links are intentional to guide you to deeper tutorials and troubleshooting.
- Visual placeholders like <ProductCard />, <InternalLinkCard />, and other components are used so the site stays consistent as we add photos and video.

## Key Mistakes We Avoid
- Publishing untested claims about cure times or product performance.
- Recommending products without noting viscosity, brush feel, and allergy considerations.
- Allowing affiliate revenue to overrule safety or honesty.
- Leaving content stale; we revisit articles when formulas or best practices change.
- Using generic AI text; everything is written in my technician voice.

## Contact and Feedback
Have questions or want me to test a product? Reach out and reference the article slug so I can respond with context. If you experienced lifting, cracking, or allergies, include lamp type, cure times, and prep steps—I troubleshoot best with details.

## Final Note from Sara
Builder gel nails should feel like a protective shell, not a gamble. I publish what works in the salon, adjust when data proves otherwise, and keep safety at the center. Thanks for trusting me with your nails.
